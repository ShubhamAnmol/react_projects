# Attempt to Understand React's Context API

## Hooks Used

1. `createContext`
2. `useContext`

## What I Learned

- Understood `createContext`'s Provider and Consumer
- Learned about `ContextProvider` functionality

## Project Description

This is a dummy project to explore the Context API.  
You can give input to one component, and then it is passed to another component using the Context API, where it is read and displayed.
